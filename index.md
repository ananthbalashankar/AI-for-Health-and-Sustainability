## Vision
Artificial Intelligence shows significant promise when applied to domains like health and sustainability. Specifically, machine learning and its applications in these domains have been well researched and have even started deployment. However, there are risks and challenges that need to be addressed in these high-stakes domains before practitioners and ML scientists can trust and scale these solutions to public use, while finding new avenues to research.

### Agenda

Through these seminar series, we will host talks from various research groups both within NYU and external collaborators in the NYC area who actively work on applying AI for Health and Sustainability. We aim to utilize the 1 hour session to facilitate interaction to gather early feedback and collaboration between researchers and practitioners in ongoing projects. The topics that would interest this group include, but are not limited to, interpretability, modeling under uncertainty, causal inference, feature engineering, domain specific modeling, structure learning, trustable ML and human-in-the-loop learning.
